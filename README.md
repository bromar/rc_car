<h4><em>High Level Description</em></h4>

This invention is a transportation designed for your home. It is created to help you move or transport items around your house. It is manually controlled by a joystick to move it up, down, left, and right. 4 motors attached to it help it move around like a car. The vehicle also has a collision detection system infront of the car. It lets you know whether it is safe or not to continue moving forward. If there are no obstacles in the way, then the LED matrix will display a GO pattern. If an object is approaching ahead, it will give you a warning signal on the matrix. Finally, if there is an object directly infront of you, then it will give you a stop signal on the matrix.
